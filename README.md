# Time-Series-Forcasting-on-Web-Traffic 

Performed time-series analysis and forecasting on Google's web traffic data to forecast number of views of Wikipedia web page

     AWS S3 , Python , Boto3 , pandas , os , Streamlit , Statsmodel , CI-CD Pipeline
    

## Project Description

 - - the lifecycle of the project is as shown - -
                   
    ![Project Structure](./images/diagram-export-1-11-2025-12_14_22-PM.png)

    1. Loading a RAW Data of Time Series into a S3 Bucket
       (Configure AWS CLI , IAM User/Permission etc etc)

    2. Modularly Coded a ETL Pipeline . The pipeline Structure is as Shown 
     
      Extracts Raw Data From S3 ---> Store in Local data/raw dir ---> Load and Transform the Data for Further Approach ---> Store transformed Data into data/processed dir

    3. ETS Decomposition the Data :
       Observed trend of the Data fluctuation are mostly consistent over time , So performed a Additive ETS

    4. Train the Data with 3 Different Model 
          ARIMA - Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average
          SARIMA - Seasonal ARIMA
          SARIMAX - Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous Variable

    6. Hyperparameter Tuned the Entire Model
          selecting the best parametes for the individual models

    7. Saved the Model in the form of Pickle file(if needed it also can be deployed in any cloud services)

    8. Streamlit Integration to Deploy the Model 

    9. Github Intergration:
        
        --> Deployed the Entire Model In Github 
        Though the Dataset was Not so Big So I didnt initialize DVC pipeline
        (For Big amount of Data We will track the Dataflow With DVC)

        --> An Automated CI/CD Pipeline is also Integrated for the automated tests and automated deployement

        > The CI-CD integration was a challenging Tasks For me bcz of the dependencies issue (Github considered Python 3.10 as 3.1 ðŸ˜…)
